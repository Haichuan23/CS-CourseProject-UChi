# CS-CourseProject-UChi-
UChicago CS department doesn't allow students to share coursework in a public repo. Please contact haichuan@uchicago.edu to see my projects. Detailed descriptions of projects are included in the README file.

Here is a brief introduction to some major projects I have done in CS courses so far, and I will update it as I take more CS courses in the future!

CMSC15100: 
The coding language is Typed Racket. In CS151, we learned basic algorithms (e.g.,insertion sort, quick sort, merge sort, recursion), data structures(e.g., list, tree, graph), and basics in functional programming. I have implemented a calendar in Typed Racket as the final project for CMSC15100. This smart calendar enables you to check the date, the day of the week, and the current time.

CMSC15200: 

The coding Language is C. In CS152, we learned pointer, more data structures(array, linked list, queue, stack, BST, hash table, Directed/Undirected Graph), algorithms(bit manipulation, BFS/DFS) and memory allocation. I have implemented a board game 'HangTime' in C as the final project for CMSC15200. The board game enables two opponents to play chess interactively, and enables gravity on the chess board.

CMSC15400: 
The coding Language is C. I have implemented the following four projects.
1) Bit manipulation & arithmetic
2) Reading Assembly code and Debugging binary bombs
3) Cache Implementation and Optimization in C
4) Shell Implementation in C (command-line parsing, forking, output redirection)

CMSC23320: Computer Networks


TTIC31020: Machine Learning (Graduate)
