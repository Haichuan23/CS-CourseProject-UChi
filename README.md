# CS-CourseProject-UChi-
UChicago CS department doesn't allow students to share coursework in a public repo. Please contact haichuan@uchicago.edu to see my projects. Detailed descriptions of projects are included in the README file.

Here is a brief introduction to some major projects I have done in CS courses so far, and I will update it as I take more CS courses in the future!

CMSC15100 Introduction to Computer Science I: 
The coding language is Typed Racket. In CS151, we learned basic algorithms (e.g.,insertion sort, quick sort, merge sort, recursion), data structures(e.g., list, tree, graph), and basics in functional programming. I have implemented a calendar in Typed Racket as the final project for CMSC15100. This smart calendar enables you to check the date, the day of the week, and the current time.

CMSC15200 Introduction to Computer Science II: 

The coding Language is C. In CS152, we learned pointer, more data structures(array, linked list, queue, stack, BST, hash table, Directed/Undirected Graph), algorithms(bit manipulation, BFS/DFS) and memory allocation. I have implemented a board game 'HangTime' in C as the final project for CMSC15200. The board game enables two opponents to play chess interactively, and enables gravity on the chess board.

CMSC15400 Computer Systems: 
The coding Language is C. I have implemented the following four projects.
1) Bit manipulation & arithmetic
2) Reading Assembly code and Debugging binary bombs
3) Cache Implementation and Optimization in C
4) Shell Implementation in C (command-line parsing, forking, output redirection)

CMSC23320 Computer Networks: This course is a rigorous introduction to computer networks. Topics cover data-link layer, network layer, transport layer, application layer, wireless network, routing protocol, network security, and IPv6.
I have implemented the following three projects with my teammate for this course. All projects are implemented from scracth (with some scaffolding code provided by the instructor).
1) a IRC protocol that supports multi-agent communication and channels. The project can directly communicate with other agents on the Internet who also
the IRC protocol. Project Description: http://chi.cs.uchicago.edu/chirc/
2) a TCP protocol that supports three-way handshake, data transmission, and connection termination. Specifically, we have enabled retransmission and 
probing mechanism to deal with unreliable network. Project Desciption: http://chi.cs.uchicago.edu/chitcp/
3) a router that can deliver message under complex network topology. Project Description: http://chi.cs.uchicago.edu/chirouter/


TTIC31020 Machine Learning (Graduate):
This is a graduate course in Machine Learning. Topics include linear regression, stochastic gradient descent, perceptron, KNN, logistic regression, SVM, Generative Model (Mixture of Gaussian/Experts, General EM Model), Tree Methods, Ensembles, Information and Learning Theory, deep learning, and a brief introduction of semi-supervised learning.

CMSC35401 Algorithmic Game Theory (Graduate):
It is a theory course with no coding involved. Content covers multi-agent ML and game theory, information economics, data market, and strategic learning.
